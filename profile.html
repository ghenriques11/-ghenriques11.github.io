                    <p>Hello! My name is Guilherme Henriques, I'm 22 years old, and I'm from Madeira, Portugal. I have always been passionate about technology and programming, which began in high school. My journey through ICT has helped me develop a wide range of skills and a deep understanding of how technology can impact the world.</p>
                    <p>Outside of tech, I enjoy sports and water activities on the island. These hobbies keep me active and give me a balanced lifestyle, which I believe is essential for success in both my personal and professional life.</p>
